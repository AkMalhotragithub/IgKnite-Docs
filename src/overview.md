# Overview

IgKnite is completely open-source and seeks to offer its user base a consistent, useful experience when it comes to commands. And we felt compelled to provide this documentation so that YOU may take use of the unified functionality that we are attempting to offer in this instance.

This documentation explains everything; from adding IgKnite to your Discord server to its commands to even self-hosting IgKnite on your machine. It is written in pure English, but we also have plans to translate it in different languages in the near future.
